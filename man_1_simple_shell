\f[B]./hsh\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a simple command language interpreter capable of executing
commands read From standard input.
This shell is also capable of having commands piped in from the
background.
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The shell is a program that reads lines from either a file or the
terminal, interprets them, and executes other commands.
Commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be piped in.
.SH INVOCATION
.PP
Shell could be run in interactive mode where input is accepted from the
keyboard.
It also works in a non\-interactive mode, the shell is run from a script
or standard input from a echo standard output.
To run the shell you should compile all the .c files in the repo with
GNU Compiler Collection and execute the output file, as follow: **$ gcc
\-Wall \-Werror \-Wextra \-pedantic *.c \-o hsh\f[B] \f[R]Where hsh
would be the file to execute:\f[B] \f[R]$ ./hsh** Simple Shell would be
run in interactive mode by executing the hsh.
Once you execute it, a prompt ($ ) will appear waiting for you to type a
command followed by an enter.
Once you press enter the shell will execute the command and a new prompt
(`$') will appear again expecting a new command.
Until you type exit or ctrl D.
